# Aether Link - Innovation & Prior Art Declaration

**Date Establish:** 2026-01-20
**Project:** Aether Link (Industrial Digital Twin Engine)

## Purpose
This document serves as a formal declaration of the unique mechanisms and intellectual property contained within the Aether Link source code, established to document prior art and original invention.

## Core Innovations

### 1. Quantum Lock Architecture
**Description:** A stabilizing mechanism for dynamic force-directed graphs in 3D space.
**Novelty:** Unlike traditional force-directed layouts that unstable jitter or require full re-computation upon data updates, Quantum Lock maintains the spatial coordinates of existing nodes ("locking" them) while only calculating physics for new or modified nodes. This ensures a stable user cognitive map during real-time data streaming.
**Implementation Reference:** `src/components/SpaceTopologyGraph.tsx`

### 2. Pulse Engine (Bayesian Bioluminescence)
**Description:** A visual feedback system mapping probabilistic health capabilities to visual rendering properties.
**Novelty:** Direct binding of Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) inference results to 3D rendering shaders (bloom intensity/color). "Pulse" animations are not pre-baked but dynamically generated based on the derivative of the belief score (rate of change), visualizing the "velocity" of risk propagation.
**Implementation Reference:** `src/logic/theme.ts`, `src/index.css`

### 3. Bayesian Causal Threading
**Description:** Real-time causal inference engine running in the browser.
**Novelty:** Decentralized Bayesian propagation where each node independently calculates its posterior probability based on parent states, allowing for scalable, client-side root cause analysis without heavy server-side processing.
**Implementation Reference:** `src/logic/BayesianEngine.ts`

### 4. Hybrid Digital Twin Workflow
**Description:** A seamless workflow combining geospatial (MapLibre) and localized studio (Three/Babylon) contexts.
**Novelty:** The methodology of capturing a "geo-snapshot" to serve as a static baseplate for high-precision local editing, bridging the gap between GIS scale (meters/kilometers) and engineering precision (millimeters).
