# Aether Link: Technical Evolution Roadmap (2026-2027)

> **Vision**: To evolve Aether Link from a digital twin MVP into **"Pantheon"** — a Universal Low-Code Platform built upon the "C++ of Systems." It will be an omnipotent engine capable of recursively modeling and executing the logic of any complex system.
>
> **Project Governance**:
> *   **Current State (2026)**: work environment MVP (Aether Link).
> *   **Future State (2027+)**: Personal Research for **MEI Master's Thesis** (Xi'an Jiaotong & SKEMA). All subsequent code iterations and the "Pantheon" evolution will be conducted in a private environment.

## Phase 1: The Crystallization of Process (Current Focus - 2026 Q2)
**Goal**: Move from discrete, scattered nodes to "Packaged Flows" (Solidifying the Foundation).
We must enable the system to define "Modules" — stable sub-structures that can be treated as single nodes in higher layers.

- [ ] **Feature: Discrete Node Packaging (Process Encapsulation)**
    - Ability to select a cluster of nodes (e.g., specific raw materials + machining steps) and "compile" them into a single **Process Block**.
    - This Process Block exposes strict Inputs/Outputs and Probability Interfaces, hiding internal complexity (Abstraction).
    - **AI Optimization**: By referencing a single "Block" ID instead of 100+ raw nodes, we drastically reduce the LLM context window usage, enabling "Precise Process Positioning" with minimal compute cost.
- [ ] **Algorithm: Local Recursion**
    - Implement the "Layered Recursive Calculation" within these individual blocks first.
    - Verify that a Block behaves deterministically based on its internal probabilistic logic.
- [ ] **Artifact**: `ProcessDefinition.schema` (Standardizing the storage format of a "Flow").

## Phase 2: The Recursive Deepening (2026 Q3 - 2026 Q4)
**Goal**: Achieve true Multi-Level Recursion (The PhD Foundation).
Once we have "Blocks", we allow Blocks to contain other Blocks indefinitely.

- [ ] **Feature: Deep Nesting Support**
    - 3D Visualization of "drilling down" into a node (Zoom-in reveals the internal graph).
    - System handles N-depth recursion without performance degradation (Quantum Lock optimization).
- [ ] **Thesis Connection**:
    - This phase provides the experimental data for the Master's Thesis.
    - Prove that "Recursion" is valid for "Manufacturing" (MBOM) containing "Services" (SBOM) containing "Hardware" (EBOM).

## Phase 3: The Pantheon Engine (2027 Q1 - 2027 Q2)
**Goal**: The "C++ of Everything" (The PhD Proposal).
Generalize the engine so it's no longer just about "Industry". It becomes a general-purpose logic solver.

- [ ] **Abstraction Layer**: 
    - Rename "EBOM/MBOM" to generic terms like "Definition/Instance" or "Class/Object".
    - Allow users to script custom node behaviors (The "Coding" aspect of the C++ analogy).
- [ ] **Universal Composability**:
    - Users can model *Economic Systems*, *Biological Ecosystems*, or *Social Dynamics* using the exact same recursive probability engine.

## Phase 4: Pantheon (The Universal Low-Code Platform) (2027 Q3+)
**Goal**: The Ultimate Product.
Aether Link serves its historical mission and transforms into **Pantheon** — the operating system for complex reality.

- [ ] **Visual Programming Interface**: A drag-and-drop IDE where users build "Systems" using our recursive blocks, not code.
- [ ] **The "Pantheon Store"**: A marketplace of pre-compiled "Process Blocks" (e.g., "Supply Chain Logic", "Network Protocol", "Social Interaction").
- [ ] **Final Form**: A world where anyone can build industrial-grade logic systems without writing a single line of code, powered by our "Neuro-Symbolic" engine.

## Immediate Next Step: "Discrete Node Packaging" Design
To start Phase 1, we need to design the "Packaging" mechanism.

### Concept: The "Black Box" Compiler
1. **Selection**: User highlights nodes A, B, C in the 3D graph.
2. **Definition**: User defines the "Interface" (What signals go in, what signals come out).
3. **Compilation**: System saves this as a static asset (`.alk` file?).
4. ** instantiation**: This asset can now be dragged-and-dropped as a single node into any other project.

> *This is equivalent to writing a function in code: You bundle logic, give it a name, and reuse it without rewriting the lines.*
